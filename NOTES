TODO
====
- test2.scala

Questions
=========
- PhasePlan vs GraalCompiler.emitHIR: should phase plans also define built-in phases?
- under what conditions is compilation deterministic? (desired for compile{}, also for stable test output)
- what is the runtime penalty for compiledMethod.executeVarargs? (LMS by contrast generates new classes)

Issues
======
- frequent code cache exhaustion (error at graalCompiler.cpp:147), will need to gc compiled code
